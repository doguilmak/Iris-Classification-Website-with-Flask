In this project, a website was created that allows predictions on Iris data by using the K-NN machine learning algorithm. First of all, a machine learning model that predicts iris data was created, and then this model was recorded through the pickle library. Afterwards, a web page was developed that allows us to guess through the pickle file.

Annotations will be added to the file...
